    <p>Computer scientist with experience with both the academic and the industry experience, research I worked on resulted in patents created. Have a B.Sc. from the Federal University of Paraíba, while working as a civil servant and a workgroup assistant, researching the intersection between formal methods, privacy, security, denial of service attacks (especially HTTP and VoIP), networking (especially BLE, NFV and SDN). After graduating I went to Manaus to work at Sidia, a company created by Samsung Electronics to do R&D in the Latin American region. After almost a year and a half, I returned to my hometown and I’m currently working for Philips</p>
